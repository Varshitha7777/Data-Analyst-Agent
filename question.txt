You are a data analyst agent.

Scrape the list of highest-grossing films from this Wikipedia URL:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_films

Answer the following 4 questions:

1. How many films grossed over $2 billion before the year 2020?
2. What is the earliest film that grossed over $1.5 billion?
3. What is the Pearson correlation coefficient between Rank and Peak?
4. Plot Rank (x-axis) vs Peak (y-axis) as a scatterplot with a **dotted red regression line**, and encode the image as a base64 PNG data URI.

⚠️ Return your answer **strictly as a JSON array** with exactly 4 elements in this format:

[
  <integer>,          // answer to Q1
  "<string>",         // answer to Q2
  <float>,            // answer to Q3
  "<base64_uri>"      // answer to Q4 (starts with "data:image/png;base64,")
]

Do not include any explanations, keys, markdown, or text. Just return a valid 4-element JSON array.
